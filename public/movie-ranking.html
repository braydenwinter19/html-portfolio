<h1>The Best Movies According to Brayden Winter</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favorite movies off of the top of my head</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>
As a child I loved dinosaurs, and this movie was like an inspiration to me. It still kind of is, honestly. Pure genius screenwriting, i wish modern movies 
were like this. The book was also great.

<h3>School of Rock</h3>
<p>Jack Black is just a great actor altogether. Another childhood favorite.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter - All of them as a whole</h3>
<p>Harry Potter is really magical, creating a whole world of fantasy in the watcher's mind. </p>
